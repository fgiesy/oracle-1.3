# The Oracle Theme

## Sees all. Knows all. Is slightly bossy.

A base, base, base, theme. The purpose of this is to have Gulp, npm, brackets.json and the folder structure set up with the most minimal effort possible.

This is assuming that each and every site we build has a custom look and feel past the basic regions and structure provided by Drupal/WP/Static HTML.

The rule of thumb is this: if you think it might maybe fit into an existing SCSS file...make a new one. Label it clearly. Keep them small and organised. Speak the Queen's english.
